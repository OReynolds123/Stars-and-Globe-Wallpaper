# Stars-and-Globe-Wallpaper
A lively HTML background featuring moving stars, a rotating globe, and smaller planets that display the weather and a button for turning on/off wifi lights when clicked.
The weather and light button require an api to work. I used openweathermap for the weather (it's free) and vesync for the wifi light button. To configure, go to the javascript.js file and update the code.
